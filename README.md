# An Analysis of School Data

## Project Overview
Performed data analysis on math and reading test scores for High School Students.  The analysis determined the top 5 performing schools, bottom 5 performing schools, math and reading passing percentage, overall passing percentage, average math and reading scores, and school performance based on budget, school size, and school type.

Upon further evaluation, the dataset presented evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically for reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth-graders. In order to uphold state-testing standards, the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth-graders were removed from the dataset.

The omission improved the passing math percentage, passing reading percentage, and overall passing percentage as follows:
- The passing math percentage changed from 66.9% to 93.2%
- The passing reading percentage changed from 69.7% to 97.0%
- The overall passing percentage changed from 65.1% to 90.6%
